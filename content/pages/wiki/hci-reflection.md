## HCI Reflection 

HCI is an acronym, which stands for "Human-Computer Interactions". The term is used to describe the way in which people connect with computers, more specifically how computer software is designed to enhance the user experience. This is achieved by improving the user interface, which is where the user will always interact with the system. When discussing HCI, you need to take into account the usability of the user interface, which is how effective and efficient the user interface is. 

Moreover, it is important to also take into account differences in cultures and nations as users learn and retain information differently depending on where they are from and how they are taught. The study of HCI is complex because technology and software are constantly evolving, therefore, forms of HCI are always changing and new forms are being developed.

HCI is important because it directly impacts the final user and their experience with the system.

HCI is more important than ever because people interact with computing systems in every aspect of their lives as we live in a modern world governed by technology. What is more, technology is advancing at such a fast rate, meaning that computing systems need to remain updated and consistent with the needs of users, thus user interfaces must be designed in a way that guarantees an optimal user experience. 

To take the example of book history "Inviting Disaster", the fact that the designers placed all the controls at the same places forced the pilot to landing manually. Fortunately he had the experience to do so, but this design flaw would have had to be anticipated by a more usable HCI design.

Beside that, designing human-computer interactions well have an important role in an enterprise. On the one hand, when users of the system can use it easily and without having to handle a new way to proceed, they can use the product more efficiently and increase their productivity.

On the other hand, on the business side, if final users are satisfied when they use the product, it will directly impact on the profitability.
Even though HCI is important, it is difficult to find better ways to improve the user experience and usability of computing systems.

Creating user interfaces with few errors and supporting faster user execution is not only about common sense or matter of luck but based on training and experience that impact on designerâ€™s mental models.

And even with years of experience and training, it is never easy to bring a fix.
Don Norman reports: "A true understanding of a tool can only come through usage, in part
because new tools change the system, thereby changing both needs and requirements."
In that, a deep understanding of the users is even more important than technical skills in making user interfaces.

Thereby, that is why HCI has to be be take in account at the very beginning of the software development process. At this point, Human-Centered Design (HCD) can be a solution. HCD is a design approach where the needs, expectations and characteristics of end users are taken into account at each stage of the product iterative development process, stages that are Observation, Ideation, Prototyping and Testing.
